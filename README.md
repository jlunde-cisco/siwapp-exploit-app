### Simple CLI App for SIWAPP Presentations to emphasize forensic capabilities

1. Change IP's in simpleNmap.bat to scan. These should be IP's of your SIWAPP servers
2. Change IP in aggressiveNmap.bat to one of your SIWAPP DB servers
3. Change the below information to your enviornment variables in remote_exploit_exec.py

```
## IP OF SIWAPP APP SERVER AND USER (Make up a comprimised user on that host if needed)
hostname = "**IP OF ANY SIWAPP APP SERVER"
username = "**CHANGE ME**"
password = "**CHANGE ME**"

## This should be the IP of the DB server found  in the  /var/www/html/config/databases.yml file...
sql_hostname = '**CHANGE ME**'
sql_username = 'siwapp'
sql_password = 'siwapp'
sql_main_database = 'siwapp'
sql_port = 3306
```
Run the list sequentially speaking on how you, as an attacker would begin by scanning remote systems broadly (running the number 1). Then you find a target and begin concentrating on it (run item 2). From there we search for databases on that host (item 3), finally finishing with item 4 which is extrapolating db information and tables from the mysql servers.
